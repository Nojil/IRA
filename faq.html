                        DOL will classify the work you do into specific job
                        codes. They are countless of job codes to look through,
                        but there can only be <em>ONE </em>job code per
                        application.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>FOR EXAMPLE:</strong> if you own a hotel and you
                        need housekeepers, dishwashers, and an outdoor
                        maintenance crew, you would need to file three separate
                        applications for those three very different jobs.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Each job code has different wages, and with each
                        application, we have to explain the seasonality and need
                        for the occupation within your business. It would be
                        impossible to put three very different types of jobs
                        onto one singular application.

                        regulation concerning “corresponding employment.” This
                        means that any non-H2 worker employed by an employer
                        that has a certified application who performs
                        substantially the

                        housing throughout the duration of the job because it is
                        seen as a benefit to the employer due to the nature of a
                        mobile workforce. These employers are not required to
                        cover or provide meal costs during the duration of the
                        job like an H2A employer would.

                        his crew mows both residential and commercial properties
                        until the end of October. His business is completely
                        shut down from November through the end of February due
                        to snow. He will begin mowing again in the spring
                        (March) when the snow has melted.

                          Peak Load employers are typically those that are open

                          peak, in the employer’s season where it becomes
                          extremely busy compared to the downtime. Workers can
                          only be requested during this peak time.

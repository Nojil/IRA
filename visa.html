              PERM Labor Certification
            </h2>
            <p class="pl-3">
              The employer needs to acquire a PERM Labor Certification. This will involve implementing a recruitment
              process to ensure that no qualified U.S. workers are available or willing to take your position. The PERM
              Labor Certification Process can take as little as 6 months after the ETA-9089 application is filed. This
              does not include the 30 days of recruitment required and the 30 days that need to pass after the end of
              the recruitment before applying. If your employer is audited, it could extend the processing time up to a
              year and a half.

            </h2>
            <p class="pl-3">
              Once a PERM has been obtained, the employer can file an I-140 Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. Under
              normal circumstances, the I-140 petition takes about 6 months to process without premium processing.
              However, with premium processing the process shorten to 15 calendar days.

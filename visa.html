              <p>
                Have you tried to find and hire local labor but found that
                American agriculture workers have dried up? You’re not alone.
                The H-2A guest worker program is what you need to help keep your
                farm operations up and going, and to avoid potential losses for
                the next season.
              </p>
              <p>
                The H-2A Visa program is designed to provide American farmers
                with a reliable, efficient and legal way to keep up with the
                demand of farm labor needs with temporary visa workers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Presently, there are a limited number of H2-A applications every
                year and that means you need to ensure your applications are
                complete, accurate and on time to have the best chance for and
                highest rate of application approval possible. It’s the best
                shot you have at getting the agricultural labor you need. But,
                it’s a time consuming process … that you honestly don’t have
                time for.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you need H-2A employees, let us help with your H-2A Visa
                applications and have peace of mind that you’ll have one of the
                best chances for success possible.

              <p class="description">
                The following specific conditions must be met by an employer who
                files an application for temporary alien labor certification
                pursuant to H2A regulations:
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>
                <b>Recruitment:</b> The employer must agree to engage in
                independent positive recruitment of U.S. workers. This means an
                active effort, including newspaper and radio advertising in the
                areas of expected labor supply.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b></b> The wage or rate of pay must be the same for U.S.
                workers and H2A workers. The hourly rate must also be at least
                as high as the applicable Adverse Effect Wage Rate, Federal or
                State minimum wage or the applicable prevailing hourly wage
                rate, whichever is higher. If the worker is paid on a piece rate
                basis and the piece rate does not result in an hourly piece rate
                earning during the period at least equal to the amount the
                worker would have earned had the worker been paid at the hourly
                rate, then the workers pay must be supplemented to the
                equivalent hourly level.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Housing:</b> The employer must provide free housing to all
                workers who are not reasonably able to return to their
                residences the same day. Such housing must be inspected and
                approved according to standards established by Occupational
                Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
              </p>
              <p>
                <b></b> The employer must provide either three meals a day to
                each worker or furnish free and convenient cooking and kitchen
                facilities for workers to prepare their own meals. If meals are
                provided, then the employer may charge each worker a certain
                amount per day for the three meals.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Transportation:</b> The employer is responsible for the
                following type of transportation of workers: (1) After the
                worker has completed fifty percent of the work contract period,
                the employer must reimburse the worker the cost of
                transportation and subsistence from the place of recruitment to
                the place of work, if such costs were borne by the worker. (2)
                The employer must provide free transportation between the
                employers housing and the worksite for any worker who is
                provided housing. (3) Upon completion of the work contract, the
                employer must pay reasonable costs of the workers subsistence
                and return transportation cost to foreign workers or provide
                transportation. The employer must advance such costs or provide
                transportation to U.S. workers as well.

            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>
                <b>Workers Compensation Insurance:</b> The employer must provide
                either Workers Compensation Insurance or insurance coverage
                equivalent to Workers Compensation Insurance, for all workers.
                Proof of insurance must be provided before certification is
                granted.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Tools and Supplies:</b> The employer must provide, at no cost
                to the worker, all tools and supplies necessary to carry out the
                work, unless it is common practice in the area and occupation
                for the worker to provide certain items.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Three-fourths Guarantee:</b> The employer must guarantee to
                offer each worker employment for at least three-fourths of the
                workdays in the work contract period and any extensions. If the
                employer affords less employment, then the employer must pay the
                amount which the worker would have earned had the worker been
                employed the guaranteed number of days.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Fifty Percent Rule:</b> The employer must agree to hire any
                qualified and eligible U.S. worker who applies for a job until
                fifty percent of the period, or the work contract, has elapsed.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Labor Dispute:</b> The employer must assure that the job
                opportunity for which H2A certification is being requested is
                not vacant because the former occupant is on strike or is being
                locked out in the course of a labor dispute.

              <p>
                <b>Seasonal need:</b> The employer must establish that the

                temporary basis due to seasonal or short-term demands with

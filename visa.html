              agricultural employers who anticipate a shortage of domestic
              workers to bring nonimmigrant foreign workers to the U.S. to
              perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or
              seasonal nature.

          </h2>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>
              <b>Recruitment:</b> The employer must engage in independent
              positive recruitment of U.S. workers. This means an active
              effort, including newspaper and radio advertising in areas of
              expected labor supply. Such recruitment must be at least
              equivalent to that conducted by non-H2A agricultural employers
              to secure U.S. workers.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Wages</b> The wage or rate of pay must be the same for U.S.
              workers and H2A workers. The rate must also be at least as high
              as the applicable Adverse Effect Wage Rate or the applicable
              prevailing wage rate, whichever is higher.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Housing:</b> The employer must provide free and approved
              housing to all workers who are not able to return to their
              residences the same day.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Meals</b> The employer must either provide three meals a day
              to each worker or furnish free and convenient cooking and
              kitchen facilities for workers to prepare their own meals. If
              meals are provided, then the employer may charge each worker a
              certain amount per day for the three meals.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Transportation:</b> The employer is responsible for the
              following different types of transportation of workers:

              <ul>
                <li>After a worker has completed 50 per cent of the work
                  contract period, the employer must reimburse the worker
                  for the cost of transportation and subsistence from the
                  place of recruitment to the place of work.</li>
                <li>The employer must provide free transportation between
                  any required housing site and the worksite for any worker
                  who is eligible for such housing.</li>
                <li>Upon completion of the work contract, the employer must
                  pay return transportation or transportation to the next
                  job</li>
              </ul>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>
              <b>Workers Compensation Insurance:</b> The employer must provide
              Workers’ Compensation or equivalent insurance for all workers.
              Proof of insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Tools and Supplies:</b> The employer must furnish at no cost
              to the seasonal agricultural workers all tools and supplies
              necessary to carry out the work, unless it is common practice
              for the workers to provide certain items.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Three-fourths Guarantee:</b> The employer must guarantee to
              offer each worker employment for at least three-fourths of the
              workdays in the work contract period and any extensions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Fifty Percent Rule:</b> The employer must employ any
              qualified U.S. worker who applies for a job until 50 per cent of
              the contract period has elapsed.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Labor Dispute:</b> The employer must assure that the job
              opportunity for which the employer is requesting H2A
              certification is not vacant due to a strike or lockout.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Certification Fee:</b> A fee will be charged to an employer
              granted temporary alien agricultural labor certification.

            <p>
              Do you need temporary, seasonal or intermittent low-skilled
              workers and can’t fill the demand with local candidates? We can
              help. The H-2B guest worker program is what you need to help
              keep your business operating at optimal performance.

            <p>
              The H-2B Visa program is designed to provide American businesses
              with access to workers for industries such as landscaping,
              seasonal hospitality, forestry, and seasonal construction
              businesses, as well as in manufacturing, food packaging, and
              retail.
            </p>
            <p>
              Presently, there are a limited number of H-2B workers that are
              issued H-2B visas every year and that means you need to ensure

              possible. It’s the best shot you have a getting seasonal you

              don’t have time for.

              If you need H-2B employees, let us help with your H-2B Visa

              An H2B temporary nonagricultural worker is an alien who is

              qualified U.S. workers capable of performing such services or
              labor are not available. The employer’s need for the services or

              in the future.

              The employer has an employment situation that is otherwise

              temporary basis due to seasonal or short-term demands with
              temporary employees who will not become a part of the regular
